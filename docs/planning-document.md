## Development Approach

### Sprint Structure
- 2-week sprints
- Daily standups
- Sprint planning at beginning
- Retrospective at end
- Demo/review with stakeholders bi-weekly

### Development Practices
- Trunk-based development with feature flags
- Code reviews for all PRs
- Test-driven development where appropriate
- Comprehensive documentation
- Regular security reviews

## Testing Strategy

### Types of Testing
- Unit Testing: Jest for component and utility function testing
- Integration Testing: API route testing with Supertest
- E2E Testing: Cypress for critical user flows
- Performance Testing: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- Security Testing: Regular OWASP audits, dependency scanning

### Test Environment
- Development: Local environments
- Staging: Production-like environment for integration testing
- Production: Live environment with monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Code commits trigger automated tests
2. Successful tests deploy to staging
3. Manual QA and approval
4. Deployment to production

### Infrastructure Provisioning
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform or Pulumi
- Environment variables managed securely
- Secrets management with appropriate vaulting

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Usage analytics
- API cost tracking

### Maintenance Plan
